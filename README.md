# AI-Itinerary-Generator
🚀 Just Built: AI-Powered Travel Itinerary Generator 🌍✈️

Tired of manually planning trips? I created a smart AI Travel Planner using LangChain + OpenAI + Streamlit that:

✅ Takes your budget, days, and interests
✅ Generates a personalized travel itinerary
✅ Suggests places to visit, food, activities, and cost breakdown!

All in seconds 🧠⚡

🔧 Tech Stack:

LangChain (LLM orchestration)

OpenAI GPT

Streamlit for frontend

💻 Deployed it locally — and planning to scale it further by adding real-time APIs like OpenTripMap, weather, maps, and export to PDF.
